# Envelope Update Plan

- [x] Update .envelope CSS: Reduce size to 400px width, 250px height for more realistic envelope proportions
- [x] Adjust .flap positioning and size to fit the new envelope dimensions
- [x] Reposition .heart to be on the flap as a seal (e.g., at the center top of the flap)
- [x] Adjust .letter size and positioning to fit inside the envelope body when opened
- [ ] Test the envelope interactivity to ensure it opens/closes correctly and message is visible
