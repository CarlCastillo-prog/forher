              Hi babyyy,<br><br>
              Today is a special day—our <strong>1st monthsary</strong>. One whole month of love, laughter, growth, and so many beautiful memories. I still remember the first time we talked, how your smile made my heart race, and how I couldn’t stop thinking about you afterward. Since then, every day with you has felt like a gift I never knew I needed.<br><br>
              You’ve brought a kind of peace and happiness into my life that I never imagined was possible. When I’m with you, everything feels lighter. The world feels kinder. I feel stronger. Your presence is my comfort zone, your voice my favorite sound, and your love the most precious thing I’ve ever received.<br><br>
              Thank you for accepting me, flaws and all. For understanding me when I couldn’t even understand myself. For being patient when I was slow, and for always being there even when things weren’t perfect. You love so purely, and that love has changed me—for the better.<br><br>
              This past months, we’ve grown not just as a couple, but as best friends. We’ve laughed until our stomachs hurt, argued over silly things, held each other through stress, and cheered each other on through wins and losses. I wouldn’t trade any of it for the world.<br><br>
              And as I look back on every hug, every kiss, every “I love you,” I just know—my heart belongs to you. Completely, endlessly, truly.<br><br>
              Here’s to 1 month of us, and to many more months and years to come. I promise to keep choosing you, loving you, and growing with you, every single day.
